# Motorcycle Helmet Detection using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT

## Objective
To enhance road safety in the Philippines by accurately identifying different types of motorcycle helmets in various conditions.

## Methodology
- Train YOLOv8 and DeepSORT models using collected data.
- Evaluate model performance through hyperparameter tuning and mAP analysis.

## Results
- Model performance improved with hyperparameter tuning, with Model 2 achieving the best mAP.
- Confusion matrices revealed common misclassifications between full-faced and half-faced helmets.

## Conclusion
Integrating DeepSORT with YOLOv8 shows promise for motorcycle helmet detection. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness across diverse conditions and locations.

## Repository Structure
- `CLAHE_processed/`: Contains datasets and training data.
